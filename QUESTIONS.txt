QUESTIONS

Q1. dig_core.sv has a signal called led. what is that signal for?
A. Use for whatever you want to use for.

Q2. dig_core.sv has a signal called "go" as output. Why output?
A. Just export to enhance visibility for Eric's TB.

Q3. Should synthesize ALU with Class exercise parameters especially inputdrive 0od 10ohms and output load of 0.01 pF?
A. Synthesize at top level directly and should hopefully see violations.

Q4. Get these errors while setting driving cell:
dc_shell> set_output_delay -clock clk 0.5 [all_outputs]

A. NO worries for these warnings.
		
Q5. Get these erros while doing "ungroup all" for motor_cntrl?
dc_shell> ungroup -all
Information: Changed wire load model for 'pwm_gen' from '(none)' to 'ZeroWireload'. (OPT-170)
Information: Changed wire load model for 'pwm_gen' from '(none)' to 'ZeroWireload'. (OPT-170)
Information: Updating graph... (UID-83)

A. Was doing this at wrong place. Should do "ungroup -all -flatten" after cimpile and then do a seconds compile after doing "ungroup -all -flatten".

6. 

Motion block: should Intgrl be rest on go low ?
  NO, it makes sense to retain value



fork join?
 Eric: not faced this before

7. Ok2Move and Ok2Move_ff1/2... which one connects to port of dig_core?

8. rst_n should not be a reg but a wire?

9. should set drive input strength on RST_n or not?? 

10. timing_unflat_report.txt shows a max delay path from state_reg to Accum through multiplier. We won't exercise this path ever? What can be done about this? Here ? In real industrial projects?
